This machine language monitor owns the most standard commands together
with some interesting features taken from my C64
<a href="../c64/assembler/">assembler</a> and some commands to 
do system calls easier.<br>
All addresses and data bytes can be given in hex, decimal (with 
preceding "."), octal (with preceding "&") or in binary (with
preceding "%"). The output of the commands M, B, R, D, G and C can 
be piped to a file with "&gt; filename", like in the shell.
<p>
<pre>
X		exits monitor (goes to shell)
D a b		disassemble from address a to b
B a b		binary list
M a b		hex dump
R		shows register contents
; a mnem
A a mnem	assembles 6502 mnemonic to address a
+ pc ac xr yr sp sr
		sets registers to a new value. a "-" instead of a 
		value leaves the register unchanged
E a b		exchanges environment block a (the a'th MMU register) with
		with memory block b
S "name" a b	save memory from a (included) to b (not included)
		in file "name". The first two bytes in the file are the 
		memory address
G a		Goto address (executes a JSR)
L a b		reads b bytes from STDIN and saves them at address a
L "name" a	Load file "name" to address a or the included load 
		address if a is left out
C a b c		Compare memory area from a to b with the area starting at c
T a b c		Transfer (copy) memory from a to b to the address c
O a b c		Occupy (fill) memory from a to b with c
P a b c		sets system parameter: a becomes the standard drive (for
		load/save), b is the number of bytes printed in a line
		with hex dump and c becomes the number of available 
		memory blocks (a 4kByte) for this task. A "-" leaves the
		value unchanged.
U a b c d e	change in the memory area from a to b all three byte 
		assembler opcode addresses pointing to the area between 
		c and d to the area starting at e
I a b c ...
, a b c ...	writes bytes b, c, ... into the memory at address a
F a b string	tries to Find the string (which is mixed from bytes, 
		separated by spaces and strings, enclosed in double quotes)
		in the address area from a to b
FA a b addressing
		search all assembler codes in memory from a to b, that have
		the given addressing mode: "FA a b (**AB)" means to search
		all absolute indirect addressing modes with low byte
		equal to $AB
FR a b		search for relative jumps
F- a b c	search in memory from a to b for bytes that are not equal to c

YD a b c	DEVCMD with device a, command b and parameter c
YM		GETMEM
YF a		FREMEM memory block a
YS		GETSTR
YR a		FRESTR stream a
YE		GETENV
YP adr env stdin stdout stderr
		FORK
YW sem		PSEM
YV sem		VSEM
YG a		tries to get memory block a with GETBLK
YC d:mask	show directory
</pre>
<h4>Memory Map</h4>
The shell and the monitor both use the zeropage addresses
from 64-128 ($40-$80) and memory addresses from 768-1024 ($300-$400).
In addition to this, of course the stack ($0100-$01ff) and the PCBUF
Send buffer ($0200-$02ff) are being used.
