<h3 align=center>OS/A65 Version 2.0</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

The change from kernel 1.3 to kernel 2.0 is radical in some things, but 
conservative in others. The complete environment handling has been 
rewritten to make it easier to port to different platforms. Also threads
have been introduced. Therefore all the memory management and 
interprocess communication calls have changed as well.
The scheduler is now a lot faster, as no more checks are done for threads
in the waiting list. 
<p>
Although most routines have been rewritten, many of these calls still
have the same parameters and behave the same way.
Also the <tt>PCBUF</tt> is still used (unfortunately). This is the general
communications buffer needed for filesystem operation and some kernel
calls. It is  a global buffer, and as such it is protected by the
<tt>SEM_SENDBUF</tt> system semaphore. Each task that wants to use
has to allocate this semaphore with <tt>PSEM</tt> before using the
buffer.
<p>
Also there still is no block oriented communication, although the 
stream based communication has been improved by the out-of-band
error, brk and push/pull flags.
<p>
I try to keep this documentation as correct and up-to-date as possible,
but if in doubt, read the source... <tt>:-)</tt>
<p>
There are now some comments like "this need not be available in all
OS implementations". These comments mostly refer to the embedded
versions of the OS where the kernel can be shortened to (almost)
2k in size by leaving out some stuff not necessary for the particular
application.

<h4><a name="kernel">Kernel Interface Description</a> </h4>
 
Most kernel routines return an error code in the accumlator (a), if the
carry flag is reset upon return. Otherwise the ac might contain data.<p>

<hr>

<pre>

$f000  	RESET   System reset

</pre><hr><pre>

$f003	ENMEM	Enable 4k memory block, no in xr, for memory management - 
		MMU version only
$f006	SETBLK	set memory block ac at MMU entry yr - returns old entry
		in ac. MMU version only

</pre><hr>
<p>
The Stream functions have not changed much. The only addition compared to 
kernel 1.x is the error code byte, that allows passing of error conditions
and push/pull signals as "out-of-band" data.
</p><p>
In the <a href="embedded.html">embedded</a> versions the stream functions 
are not necessarily implemented.
</p>
<pre>

$f009	GETSTR	Get a free stream. increase read and write task counter,
		returns stream number in x

$f00c	FRESTR	decreases read and write task counter, thus freeing the
		stream, if both result in zero. parameter: stream number in x

$f00f	PUTC	puts a byte on the stream. parameter: stream number in x,
		data byte in a. returns errorcode in a

$f012	GETC	Get a byte from the stream. parameter: stream number in x,
		returns data byte in a (with carry=0) or error code 
		(carry=1)

$f015	UNGETC	Gives byte from stream back. parameter: stream number in x,
		data byte in a, returns error code in a

$f018	STRCMD	executes a stream command. parameter: stream number in x,
		stream command in a, returns error code in a.

		possible stream commands are:

		SC_GET		0	same as GETSTR
		SC_REG_RD	1	increase read task counter by one
		SC_REG_WR	2	increase write task counter by one
		SC_CLR		3	empty the stream
		SC_EOF		4	closing the stream from the sender 
					side, i.e. decrease write task 
					counter by one
		SC_NUL		5	closing the stream from the receiver
					side, i.e. decrease read task 
					counter.
		SC_FRE		6	same as FRESTR
		SC_STAT		7	read stream status into ac
		SC_GANZ		8	returns number of bytes in stream in a
		SC_RWANZ	9	returns the stream write pointer in
					a and the stream read pointer in y

		SC_ESTAT	10	Get the error code byte in yr,
					and the normal (i.e. what you get
					with SC_STAT) stream state in ac.
		SC_SSTAT	11	Set bits in the error code byte
					each bit set in yr is set in error byte
		SC_CSTAT	12	Clear bits in the error code byte
					each bit set in yr is cleared in error 
					byte
					

		Possible stream status are:

		E_NUL		Noone reading from stream
				(i.e. read task counter is zero)
		E_EOF		stream is empty and noone is writing anymore
				(i.e. write task counter is zero)
		E_SEMPTY	stream buffer is empty
		E_SFULL		stream buffer is full
		E_SLWM		number of bytes below Low Water Mark 
				(1/4 buffer size)
		E_SHWM		number of bytes above Hogh Water Mark
				(3/4 buffer size)

		The error code byte has the following bits:

		SCE_PULL	%10000000  reader pulls data from sender
		SCE_PUSH	%01000000  writer pushes data to receiver
		SCE_BRK		%00100000  writer sends 'break' signal
		SCE_RERRM	%00001100  reader error condition mask
		SCE_WERRM	%00000011  writer error condition mask

</pre>
The error condition byte can be set and read from both ends. This byte is 
cleared when the stream is allocated. If the reader "pulls" data, this is
a sign for the writer to flush all its internal buffers into the stream.
When this is done, the writer clears the pull flag.
<p>
If the writer wants to push his data (like after an CR on a terminal,
for example) the reader should get the number of bytes in the stream to 
have an inidcation of how many bytes to read as "pushed" (or urgent in 
Internet speak). Then it removes the push flag and gets the bytes from the
stream
<p>
If an error occurs, e.g. a read error when reading a file, the writer
sets all the bits in the error code byte masked by SCE_WERRM to 1 
(which is general error code - other codes still have to be defined).
The reader of the stream then reads this and can handle the error.
<p>
If an error on the reading side occurs (like disk full when writing
a file),  The reader sets all the error bits masked by SCE_RERRM to 1
(which is general error code - other codes still have to be defined).
The writer can then close the file on his side.
<p>
If the writer wants to send a <tt>Break</tt> (i.e. a <tt>^C</tt> equivalent) 
code to the reader, it sets
the <tt>SCE_BRK</tt> bit. The reader must clear it itself.
<p>
<hr><pre>

$f01b	DEVCMD	executes device commands. parameter: device number in x,
		device command in a, optional parameter in y.
		returns error code in a.

		possible stream commands are:

		DC_IRQ		0	execute IRQ routine
					the interrupt routine has to return
					E_OK if an interrupt source is cleared
					or E_NOIRQ if not.
		DC_RES		1	initialize device
		DC_GS		2	sets the stream (in y) the device 
					reads from
		DC_PS		3	sets the stream (in y) the device 
					writes to
		DC_RX_ON	4	switch on receive
		DC_TX_ON	5	switch off receive
		DC_RX_OFF	6	switch on send
		DC_TX_OFF	7	switch off send
	
		DC_SPD		8	set speed (in y), device dependend
		DC_HS		9	set handshake (in y), device dependend
		DC_ST		10	get device status, device dependend
		DC_EXIT		11	disable device, including IRQ sources

		DC_GNAM		16	get the name of a device, parameter:
					device number in x, returns 
					name PCBUF ($0200)
		DC_GNUM		17	get number of a device from name,
					parameter: name in PCBUF, length
					of name in x, returns device number 
					in x
		DC_REGDEV	18	register new device(s)

</pre>
		With the registration of the device the system has to know
		what to do with it and where to put it in memory.
		Therefore you have to put the address of the following 
		struct into x/y registers.
<pre>		
		
		x/y -&gt          2 byte pointer to label1
				JMP Start_of_1st_device
				Name_of_device,0
				...
		label1		2 byte pointer to label2
				JMP Start_of_2nd_device
				Name_of_2nd_device,0
				...
		labeln		$ffff
 
</pre>		
		With this method it is possible to register several devices,
		as long as they are in one memory block, with one call.
		
		The devices are started with DC_RESET. In y they get a
		system feature byte. Currently only bit 7 is defined,
		where $00 is 1 MHz system clock and $80 is 2 MHz system clock.
<p><hr><pre>

$f01e	FORK	start a new task. parameter: yr = length of the following
		struct in PCBUF

		FORK_SIZE	0	The size of the needed memory
					in 256 byte blocks, from botton up
		FORK_SHARED	1	number of 256 byte blocks that 
					share the mapping with the current
					task, from top down. 
		FORK_PRIORITY	2	priority of new task (0=inherit
					from parent)
		FORK_STDIN	3	stdin stream
		FORK_STDOUT	4	stdout stream
		FORK_STDERR	5	stderr stream
		FORK_ADDR	6	start address of task
		FORK_NAME	8	name of the program, ended by a 
					nullbyte. After that follows the 
					command line that started the program.

		FORK returns the PID of the new task in xr.
</pre>
		The commandline is put into the PCBUF of the starting 
		task. The new task gets its own task id in x
		The stream read/write task counter are not changed.
		I.e. a thread that wants to use the end given to fork too
		has to increase the read/write counters itself.
<p>
		The priority is a hack to allow to run tasks with different
		execution priorities. The priority
		counts the number of interruptions before a thread 
		switch occurs. Default value is 3. A value of 0 lets
		the new task inherit the priority of the current task.
<p>
		It is now somewhat difficult to really start a new task, as
		the READ/WRITE routines to access another tasks memory
		have been removed. <br>
		One standard procedure could be to write a boot routine
		into the current PCBUF, after the command line, and
		jump to this boot routine when the FORK parameters are
		copied to the target PCBUF. The length parameter
		to FORK must of course include this routine.<br>
		You could also use a routine in the ROM, which then
		should be shared between the calling and the called
		task. The boot routine can then load the executable.<br>
		For a stdlib with null-separated command line parameters,
		they may also be included after the name, as long as the
		length byte includes them too.<br>
<p>
		In fact, the FORK_NAME entry is somewhat arbitrary at this
		time, as it is not used within the kernel. In fact, 
		one could write anything there. But to keep compatible,
		the name and command line must have the same format
		as for the ROM startup, i.e. a nullbyte separated list
		of program name and parameter, with a zero-length parameter
		at the end.
<p>
		The newly created task must release
		the SEM_SENDBUF semaphore for the PCBUF.

<pre>

$f021	TERM	&lt;- a = return code
		ends the current thread. If still threads in the tasks are
		running, the return code is ignored. Otherwise the return 
		code is sent to the parent with SIGCHLD.

$f024	KILL	&lt;- a = return code, x = task id
		ends a complete task, with all threads in them. 
		ac is return code, xr is task ID to kill.
		The return code is sent to the parent with SIGCHLD.

$f027	YIELD	just give control back to the scheduler, as there is nothing
		to do at the moment - but keep running (not needed for
		preemtive multitasking, an interrupt interrupts any task!)

$f02a	FORKT	forks a new thread in the current task. Execution start
		address must be in a/y.
		returns c=0 for ok and new thread no in xr;
		or c=1 for error (errno in AC).

$f02d	SBRK	(carry=1): sets the freely available RAM area in the
			   active environment to ac blocks with 256 byte 
			   each, by adding memory to or removing memory 
			   from the end of the already available memory 
			   area. Returns in ac the length
			   of the available memory in 256 byte blocks,
			   if c=0 on return. Otherwise returns error.
		(carry=0): returns in ac the length of the available 
			   memory in 256 byte blocks. 

$f030	GETINFO	getinfo returns process information about all (up to 16) 
		running processes in the PCBUF (which must be allocated
		by the process before)
		
		May not be available in all OS implementations.

		There are ANZ_ENV valid entries in the table, a 
		0 in the TN_NTHREADS field indicates an empty slot.

		The fields are as follows:

		TN_PID		0	PID of process in this entry
		TN_NTHREADS	1	Number of threads for process
		TN_ENV		2	Environment number for process
		TN_PARENT	3	Parent process
		TN_MEM		4	amount of allocated RAM
		TN_SIGNAL	5	signal address
		TN_STDIN	7	STDIN stream
		TN_STDOUT	8	STDOUT stream
		TN_STDERR	9	STDERR stream
		TN_SIGMASK	10	signal mask value
		TN_NAME		11	start of prog name (if available)

		each field is TN_SLEN bytes long and the
		length of the name field is TNAMLEN. If the name is longer
		than TNAMLEN-1, the the last characters are cut off, and in
		the table the ending nullbyte is missing.

<!-- This is now internal only!
		The thread status can have the values given below:

		TS_FRE		0	env is free
		TS_ENV		1	env in use, but no task
		TS_IBRK		2	task executed BRK opcode in interrupt
					routine
		TS_BRK		3	task executed BRK opcode
		TS_RDY		4	task is runnable (as after YIELD)
		TS_IRQ		5	task is interrupted 
		TS_WFRX		6	waiting for a receive from another 
					task
		TS_WFTX		7	waiting for a send from another task
		TS_WXTX		8	waiting on send from a specified task
		TS_WFSEM	9	waiting on semaphore
-->

$f033	DUP	(carry=1): set new STD* stream. parameter: STD* number in x,
		new stream in a, returns old stream in ac;
		read/write task counters are not touched!
		(carry=0): get redirected STD* stream number. parameter:
		STD* number in x, returns stream in a

</pre><hr>
<p>
The semaphore calls need not be available in all OS implementations.
</p>
<pre>

$f036	GETSEM	gets a free semaphore. returns semaphore number in x

$f039	FRESEM	frees a semaphore. parameter: semaphore number in x
		negative (system) semaphores cannot be freed (nor are they 
		returned by GETSEM)

$f03c	PSEM	'PSEM' operation on a given semaphore. task waits till
		semaphore is freed. parameter: semaphore number in x
		carry=0: block till semaphore is free
		carry=1: do a test&set operation and return with 
		E_OK if semaphore gotten, or E_SEMSET if semaphore is in use.

$f03f	VSEM	'VSEM' operation on semaphore, allows other tasks
		to grab the semaphore.
		parameter: semaphore number in x

</pre>
<hr><pre>

$f042	SEND	send a message to another task
		parameter: optional message type in a, target task in x,
		length of data in PCBUF in y; y=0 means 256 byte in PCBUF
		The data is in PCBUF ($0200-$02ff). returns a and y as 
                given and the 'redirected' target (e.g. from filesystem 
                manager) in x

$f045	RECEIVE	receives a message.
		(carry=1): waits for any message
		(carry=0): returns immediately, with an error if no message
		received. Otherwise if a message is received, 
		return sender task id in x, length of
		data in PCBUF in y (0 means 256) and the optional message
		type as given with SEND in a.

</pre><hr><pre>

$f048	SETSIG	sets the signal address and the signal mask
		(carry=1): sets signal address in a/y
		(carry=0): sets signal mask
		returns the old mask resp. the old signal address
		in the same registers.

$f04b	SENDSIG	c=1: ac contains the signal mask to be sent to the task ID 
		given in xr
		c=0: set thread to sleep until it receives a signal

</pre>
Signal handling works as follows: With SETSIG the signal address and the 
signal mask can be set. There is only one signal address, that is the 
address of a subroutine that is called on a signal. When the routine is
called, it has the current pending signal mask in AC. 
The routine must return with a code sniplet
<pre>
	pla
	rti
</pre>
which jumps directly to the code executed before the signal occured.
Note that the x and y register must not be changed or must be preserved
during the signal routine. The current thread execution is changed
to run the signal handler and to immediately return with the code like above.
<p>
SENDSIG can be called from other tasks or from devices, not from a thread
in the same task. When SENDSIG is called, first the signal mask is checked
to see if the signal is allowed. If it is not, SENDSIG just returns.
If the signal is allowed, threads in the receiving task can be 
in different states: Ready, Interrupted, or Waiting. If ready or
interrupted, the thread is directly set up to execute the signal
routine. If the thread is waiting, it depends on the INT bit in the
signal mask what happens. 
<p>
If the INT bit is set, then any system call that lets the thread block
(i.e. wait for Semaphore, wait for Receive, wait for Send)
will be interrupted. They then return E_INT in ac - after the signal routine
has been called. The other registers are bogus after an interrupted
system call.
<p>
If the INT bit is not set, then the signal is pending, and the 
signal routine is called when a thread of the task is set to running
again.
<p>
Signal mask values are
<pre>
	SIG_INT		%10000000	/* allow interruptable kernel calls */
	SIG_CHLD	%01000000	/* Child process has terminated */
	SIG_TERM	%00100000	/* Child process has terminated */

	SIG_USR4	%00001000	/* user signal 4 - used for STDLIB */
	SIG_USR3	%00000100	/* user signal 3 */
	SIG_USR2	%00000010	/* user signal 2 */
	SIG_USR1	%00000001	/* user signal 1 */
</pre>
When a SIG_CHLD is executed, the receiving task is notified that a child
has died. This means it should call CHECKCHLD to see which child has
died with what error code. 
<p>
The SIG_TERM code should be used by "standard" libraries. Currently there
is no way to inform a task about its death and let it clean up all
resources - that are not bookkept by the kernel! - before it dies.
So other libraries should, instead of calling "KILL", send a SIG_TERM signal
when they want to kill a process. The signal routine of the receiving 
process should catch this signal and clean up and then call 
TERM itself.
<p>
SENDSIG with carry clear (wait for signal) must be called by threads only,
not by devices. Also the SIG_INT bit must be set before this call is done.
If there is only one thread in the task, then the thread is sleeping until
a signal is received. When a signal is received, the signal handler is
called, then the thread is awakened and returns with <tt>E_INT</tt>.
The other registers are not preserved.
<p>
<hr><pre>

$f04e	TDUP	register a task for a (negative) system task number.
		parameter: (negative) task number to replace in x,
		new task number to be used instead in a

$f051	XRECEIVE receives a message from a specified task only. parameter as
		with RECEIVE, plus sender task id in x

$f054	SETNMI	in systems without MMU, set the system NMI routine address.
		(carry=1): set the new NMI routine address (in a/y)
			   returns the old NMI address in a/y.
			   The old address is saved in the place pointed
			   to by (newadress-4) (see below) by this routine.
		(carry=0): clear NMI routine.
		The NMI routine has to save all registers by itself!

		At NMI address -2 there must be the address of a ctrl routine
		that can be called via CTRLNMI. Expect that the 
		ctrlnmi routine is called during this SETNMI  with either
		NMI_ON of NMI_OFF in AC, to set the initial state.
		The ctrlnmi routines is called with JSR, i.e. return with RTS.

		At NMI address -4 is a pointer to a memory location
		where the address of the next NMI routine can be found.
		If the address found there is $ffff, then the list is at
		its end.

		A possible scenario then is:

		Task calls SETNMI with NEWNMI in a/y. We then have the 
		structure:

		(NEWNMI-4)	address of oldvec --&gt   address of OLDNMI
		(NEWNMI-2)	address of nmictrl			
		NEWNMI --&gt  	NMI routine code

		This way the structure can be held in ROM, and still allow
		flexible NMI chaining. If CTRLNMI is called, each of the 
		nmictrl routines is called with the given value in AC.

$f057	CTRLNMI	Send command in AC to all currently chained NMI ctrl 
		routines as described with SETNMI. Possible values are:

		NMI_ON  = allow NMIs 
		NMI_OFF = disallow NMIs

		This routine is called when initiating and ending an
		IEC serial bus transfer, for example.

</pre><hr><pre>

$f05a	GETPID	returns the current task ID in x and the current thread ID
		in y

$f05d	SLOCK	c=1: locks scheduler to actual task. 
		c=0: unlocks scheduler
		returns c=0 when ok, c=1 with E_NOTIMP if error.

		May not be available in all OS implementations.

$f060	RENICE	changes the priority of the current task.
		ac = value to add to the priority.
		returns ac = old priority.

		May not be available in all OS implementations.

$f063	CHECKCHLD
                returns:
		c=0: returns a child process ID in x and child return code
		in a of a child process that has died. Only works
		if the SIGCHLD signal mask has been set when the 
		child died.
		c=1: no child that has died found.

<h4><a name="bootup">ROM bootup</a></h4>
<p>
During bootup, the kernel initializes the memory and sets up the standard
system memory configuration. This includes mapping the system ROM from 
the top of memory down, and the system RAM is mapped from the lower end up.
<p>
When the system initialization is done, the ROM is searched for executable
files. The first two bytes of the ROM are taken as an address. 
If this address is not <tt>$ffff</tt>, then directly after the first two
bytes follows the program ROM structure described below.
After starting the first file, the address at the beginning is taken
as a pointer to the next file and so forth, until the kernel finds
a <tt>$ffff</tt>.
<p>
The program ROM structure looks like:
<pre>
	P_KIND		0	/* byte, type of file			*/
	P_ADDR		1	/* word, start address of execution	*/
	P_RAM		3	/* byte, amount of RAM needed from 
				   lower end of memory in 256-byte 
				   blocks				*/
	P_SHARED	4	/* byte, size of memory shared with 
				   parent counted from top of memory, 
				   in 256-byte blocks			*/
	P_PRIORITY	5	/* byte, priority of the task to be 
				   started				*/
	P_DEV		6	/* 2 byte, the first byte gives the 
				   device number that is opened for the
				   stdin stream, the second gives the
				   device number for stdout/stderr	*/
	P_NAME		8	/* name of the program, ended by 
				   nullbyte. After the nullbyte is the
				   commandline the program is started
				   with. The parameter are separated
                                   by nullbytes. After the last parameter
                                   follow two nullbytes to indicate
                                   the end of the command line. */
</pre>

There are several program types available:

<pre>
	PK_PRG		0	/* simple program 			*/
	PK_DEV		1	/* device block				*/
	PK_FS		2	/* filesystem				*/
	PK_INIT		3	/* ROM init process			*/
</pre>

These file types have to be filled into the <tt>P_KIND</tt> field above. 
In addition they can be or'd by the following flags.

<pre>
	PK_AUTOEXEC	$80	/* autoexecution 			*/
	PK_RESTART	$40	/* restart when died			*/
</pre>

When the <tt>PK_AUTOSTART</tt> bit is not set, the file is ignored by 
the kernel.
<p>
The ROM only starts device blocks (<tt>PK_DEV</tt>) and init processes
(<tt>PK_INIT</tt>), because they are set up before the scheduler starts
and therefore the <tt>PCBUF</tt> is (on non-MMU systems) not available.
I.e. init processes do not check their command line, and do not release
the <tt>PCBUF</tt>.
Also <tt>PK_INIT</tt> tasks get no stdin, stdout and stderr streams
and have to set them up themselves.
<p> When starting device blocks, the address given in the
<tt>P_ADDR</tt> field is given to the <tt>DEVCMD</tt> command to register
the devices.
<p>
When using the special init process (init v1.0 from the sysapps directory),
the other entries are started by the init process. 
<tt>PK_PRG</tt> tasks are started with their stdin/out/err opened
to the devices given by the <tt>PK_DEV</tt> field. 
The name and command line are copied from the <tt>P_NAME</tt> field
to the <tt>FORK_NAME</tt> field for the fork. 
<p>
<tt>PK_FS</tt> are started as programs, but with the stdin/out/err 
streams set to <tt>STDNUL</tt>, which is ignored.
<p>
If the init process is configured for it, and the <tt>PK_RESTART</tt>
bit is set, it registers the task id of the started process and
restarts it when the task dies.
<p>
<h4><a name="vars">Variable allocation</a></h4>
<p>
ROM tasks are started from the <tt>init</tt> task and have no way to
determine which RAM locations are used by other tasks. 
Therefore the variable allocation must be done when the ROM is 
assembled. When using an MMU-based system, where each task has its 
own memory environment there need not be much caution. But when
all tasks use the same environment (like in the C64) care has to be 
taken not to use a memory location twice. Especially shared libraries
must use an own memory range, and they must be <strong>thread-save</strong>.
This allows for different threads of one task as well as threads
of different tasks to use the same library in one memory environment.
<p>
For each environment, task and thread the kernel saves two bytes that
are guaranteed to be unique within the environment, task or thread
respectively. The bytes at addresses 2 and 3 are set to zero when
a memory environment is created and are unique to this environment.
The bytes at addresses 4 and 5 are unique to the task and can be
used for task-specific data, like a pointer to a task structure.
The bytes at addresses 6 and 7 are unique to the thread and
can be used for thread data.
<hr>
<h4><a name="config">Configuration when building</a></h4>
<p>
The kernel is configurable in a wide range. Many options are available
for all versions, but also many options are architecture dependent.
The options are generally set in a global file that builds a 
system ROM. Therefore, to not set the options in the kernel file
itself, the macro <tt>ROM</tt> must be defined.
<p>
General options:
<pre>
	CMOSCPU		/* have (rockwell) R65C02		*/
	NMIDEV		/* allows handling of NMI in devices
			   (only for non-MMU systems, untested)	*/
	NMIRESET	/* calls RESET when an NMI arrives	*/

	STACKCOPY	/* on non-MMU systems the stack can 
			   either been split up or, with this
			   options, copied to a save area	*/
</pre>
Memory options:
<pre>
	RAMSIZE		/* size of checked RAM during bootup, 
			   in 256-byte blocks			*/
	MIN_MEM		/* minimum memory size to boot		*/
	RAMTEST		/* if set, RAM is tested, if not RAMSIZE
			   is taken to be the real RAM size	*/
	BATMEM		/* memory is not cleared but kept during
			   memory test				*/
	NOMIRRORMEM	/* can be set if we _know_ that we do
			   not have mirrored memory		*/
	MEMINIVAL	/* value with which to set the memory at
			   boot. If not set, 0			*/
</pre>
Some Architecture specific options:
<pre>
	NOSYSPORT	/* The CS/A65 computer has a certain 	*/
			   port where it can read the IRQ line
			   for example. Not available if set	*/
	ROMTEST		/* on CS/A65 systems allow booting from	
			   a running OS/A65 (replacing it)	*/ 
</pre>
Kernel configuration options for various system calls are the following.
The second half is mostly used to customize for embedded applications.
<pre>
	NEED_CHECKCHLD	/* checkchld available if set 		*/
	NEED_GETINFO	/* getinfo available if set		*/
	NEED_RENICE	/* renice available if set		*/
	NEED_SLOCK	/* slock available if set		*/

	NO_STREAMS	/* streams not available if set		*/
	NO_FSM		/* filesystem manager not avail. if set	*/
	NO_SEM		/* semaphores not available if set	*/
	NO_SEND		/* no send/receive/xreceive if set	*/

	EOK_SEPARATE	/* kernel is not at end of ROM - 	*/
			/* kernel/end.a65 is included extra.	*/
	EOK_NOFILL	/* don't fill between kernel and end of */
			/* it. kinit _must_ copy the stuff from	*/
			/* eok_addr to $fff*			*/
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="porting">Porting</a></h4>
<p>
Porting has been made much easier with this kernel version.
In general, there is a <tt>proto</tt> architecture subdirectory that holds 
some prototype files for a non-MMU system. that can easily be changed to
fit own needs.
<p>
The kernel needs two files in the arch/*/kernel subdirectory, namely
<tt>kenv.a65</tt> and <tt>kinit.a65</tt>. The <tt>kinit.a65</tt>
file is included in the kernel startup code, i.e. after setting
the interrupt flag and clearing the decimal flag this file is 
executed, and it is expected that the
CPU gets out of this file at the end of it.
<p>
<h5>kinit.a65</h5>
<p>
This file must initialize the stack, the memory management and mapping of the 
system ROM and RAM. 
Then the system preemption timer must be set up. 
When including <tt>kernel/zerotest.a65</tt> and <tt>kernel/ramtest.a65</tt> here
all the memory options from above are available.
Also the ramtest file returns the size of memory found in 256-byte blocks
in a. This value must be passed to the end of the init routine in this file.
<p>
In addition to this some Macros have to be defined, that are used
in the kernel later.
<pre>
  	GETFREQ()	returns a=0 for 1Mhz, a=128 for 2MHz
  	LEDPORT		address of LED port to signal hardware failures
  	LED_LED		bit of LED bit in LEDPORT address
  	H_ERROR()	if LEDPORT is not defined, then H_ERROR replaces
    	                the LED toggle routine if needed.
  	CLRTIMER()	clear the system preemption timer interrupt
  	KERNELIRQ()	returns if an interrupt occured in the kernel
     	                or outside. Is checked by "BNE IRQ_in_Kernel"
  	SAVEMEM()	save system mem config for interrupt
  	RESTOREMEM()	restore system mem config after interrupt
  	STARTMEM()	This is used to alloc/enable memory pages found
     	                during kernel init. Takes mem size in AC as given
   	                by the kernel init. It is called _after_ inimem!
</pre>
For the most systems without MMU, most of these macros can be
taken from the C64 <tt>kinit.a65</tt> file.
If you have a more complicated mapping, you can have a look at the
CS/A65 <tt>kinit.a65</tt> file.
<p>
<h5>kenv.a65</h5>
<p>
The <tt>kenv.a65</tt> file is included in another part of the kernel.
It is the part that maps the memory according to the environment
number for each task.
Several routines must be defined here:
<pre>
	inienv		init environment handling
	setthread	set active thread
	initsp		init task for thread (no in xr)
	push		push a byte to active threads stack 
	pull		pull a byte from active threads stack
	memtask		jump to active thread
	memsys		enter kernel

	getenv		get e free environment
	freenv		free an environmen
	sbrk		reduce/increase process memory in an environment

	enmem		enable memory blocks for environments
			(this kernel call is used for MMU systems and
			heavily system specific)
	setblk		sets a specific memory block in the memory map	
			of the active task. Also for MMU systems only
</pre>
Also some macros must be defined:
<pre>
	MEMTASK2()	This is equivalent to memtask above, but it
			is used for returns from interrupt
	MAPSYSBUF	maps the PCBUF of the active task to the
			address given by SYSBUF in system memory
	SYSBUF		mapped tasks PCBUF
	MAPENV()	maps the address given in a/y in env x to somewhere
			in the kernel map, returns mapped address in a/y
	MAPAENV()	as MAPENV, but does it for actual env.
	GETTASKMEM	returns (in AC) how much memory a task has
			(task id in y)
	CPPCBUFRX	copies PCBUF from other task (yr) to active one
	CPPCBUFTX	copies PCBUF from active task to another one (yr)
	CPFORKBUF()	copies the PCBUF from the FORK call to the task.
	GETACTENV()	returns active environment in ac
</pre>
The full descriptions can be found in the C64 kenv file for example.
This may look complicated, but it isn't. If you have a simple 6502 system
without memory management, just copy (or set a link) to the C64 file.
If you have a more complicated system, have a look at the CS/A65 file.
