<hr>
The kernel filesystem interface should not be used by normal applications
anymore. Instead the lib6502 calls should be used.
<pre>

The interface to the filesystems is handled by the standard send/receive
and stream routines. To access a file, a message has to be sent to the
filesystem manager, i.e. to task id SEND_FM.
To 'mount' a filesystem to a drive, the task has to register itself with
the filesystem manager. To do this, it sends a message of type FM_REG
to the filesystem manager. In PCBUF ($0200), the message contains
the number of drives to register (FM_REG_DRVS) and the task id of
the filesystem task (FM_REG_ENV).

/*        FileManager              */

#define   SEND_FM        $fe

#define   FM_REG         0

#define   FM_REG_DRVS    0
#define   FM_REG_ENV     1


All other messages to the filesystem manager have to have the drive in
PCBUF+FM_OPEND_DRV to allow easy redirection. '/' is used to separate 
dirs from each other in a filename.

#define   FM_OPEN_DRV    0

#define   DIRSIGN        "/"       /* Trennzeichen zwischen Verzeichnissen */


The following message types are defined, although not all have been 
implemented. 

#define   FS_OPEN_RD     1         /* Open file for reading only */
#define   FS_OPEN_WR     2         /* Open file for writing only (with error
				      if file exists) */
#define   FS_OPEN_RW     3         /* Open file for read and write */
#define   FS_OPEN_OW     4         /* Open file for overwriting */
#define   FS_OPEN_AP     5         /* Open file for append */
#define   FS_OPEN_DR     6         /* Open directory for reading */
#define   FS_RENAME      7         /* rename file */
#define   FS_DELETE      8         /* remove file */
#define   FS_FORMAT      9         /* format disk */
#define   FS_CHKDSK      10        /* check disk */
#define   FS_CLOSE       11        /* close file (only for FS_OPEN_RW) */
#define   FS_RMDIR       12        /* remove subdirectory */
#define   FS_MKDIR       13        /* create subdirectory */
#define   FS_CHDIR       14        /* ----                                 */
#define   FS_ASSIGN      15        /* ----                                 */

/* struct, that has to be sent in PCBUF for any FS_OPEN_* message */
/* after a successful open with FS_OPEN_RD/WR/OW/AP, the filesystem
tries to read data from stream or write to it. It ends when it
gets an E_EOF on reading streams or E_NUL on writing streams.
If a file is read to the end, the filesystem decrements the write
task counter (thus signaling the end of file) and closes the file
internally */
 
#define   FS_OPEN_DRV    0         /* drive = FM_OPEN_DRV */
#define   FS_OPEN_STR    1         /* stream over which the data is 
				      transfered */
#define   FS_OPEN_PFAD   2         /* ----                                 */
#define   FS_OPEN_NAME   3         /* name of the file to be opened */

/* struct to be sent for any message except FS_OPEN_* */

#define   FS_CMD_DRV     0    /* target drive */
#define   FS_CMD_PFAD    1    /* ---  */
#define   FS_CMD_FIL     2    /* ---  */
#define   FS_CMD_NAME    3    /* for rename, the original filename has to
				 be sent as usual, but after the nullbyte 
				 at the end of the first name follows the 
				 name the file has to be renamed to, 
				 ended with a nullbyte */

/* struct that is sent back by the filesystem task */

#define   FS_X_ERR       0         /* error code, that is also returned 
				      in the accumulator */
#define   FS_X_ENV       1         /* task id of filesystem task */
#define   FS_X_FIL       2         /* file handle (for FS_OPEN_RW only) */
#define   FS_X_SLEN      3         /* length of this struct (not sent) */


A directory is being read as a normal file, but the file has a structrure,
that is being described here.

/* struct of a directory entry in a directory file */

#define   FS_DIR_LEN     0    /* length of file, 4 byte, lo byte first */
#define   FS_DIR_YEAR    4    /* year -1900, */
#define   FS_DIR_MONTH   5    /* month, */
#define   FS_DIR_DAY     6    /* day, */
#define   FS_DIR_HOUR    7    /* hour, */
#define   FS_DIR_MIN     8    /* minute, */
#define   FS_DIR_SEC     9    /* and second of last change */
#define   FS_DIR_MODE    10   /* type of file */
#define   FS_DIR_NAME    11   /* name, ended with a nullbyte */

/* file types */

#define   FS_DIR_MOD_FIL 0    /* normal file */
#define   FS_DIR_MOD_NAM 1    /* disk name */
#define   FS_DIR_MOD_FRE 2    /* number of free bytes in FS_DIR_LEN */
#define   FS_DIR_MOD_DIR 3    /* subdirectory */


Now comes the definition of an executable file, as interpreted by the ROM
startup and by the shell.

/*	Prg-Header		*/

#define	P_KIND		0	/* type of program */
#define	P_MEM		1	/* memory size in kByte */
#define	P_RES		2	/* --- */
#define	P_ADR		4	/* start address of program */
#define	P_TAB		6	/* memory relocation table: a series of two 
				   bytes, the first describing the position 
				   in the MMU map, the second the memory block
				   to map in this position. This is used
				   to map the ROM in the memory for 
				   autostart executables. The table is ended
				   with a single $ff. */

/*	Prg-types 		*/

#define	PK_PRG		0	/* program executable */
#define	PK_DEV		1	/* device block - memory size is ignored and
				   exactly one position in the relocation table
			    	   has to be set. These values are given to
				   REGDEV.
#define	PK_FS		2	/* filesystem - STD* streams are set to 
				   STDNUL */


Appendix
--------

For the FAT filesystem, several disk sizes have been defined for the 
format command. The disk size is stored in the FS_CMD_PFAD byte in PCBUF.
